# AI vs Human-Generated Image Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on distinguishing between AI-generated and human-generated images.

## Approach
**Baseline Model:**
   - We initially implemented a ConvNet  using  features from **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** and **Canny Edge detection **  to combine with the features mined the the ConvNet itself to make predictions.
